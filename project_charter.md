## 1. Introduction

Our project partners would like the team members to create an interactive dashboard by using data from the Child and Adolescent Mental Health to identify the provinces in society that need more focus and demographics trends over the years reporting cases about anxiety and substance abuse cases. This will help understand the one of the key issue of mental health and lack of mental health professional in Canada across all provinces.

Current Version: 1.9

Project Manager (and sponsor): Group 2
## 2. Overview

We, members of Group 2 are planning to explore the data and create and in house dashboard accessible to all users of Kaggle for the research of mental health in Canada.

### 2.1 Objectives

Dashboard about mental health pre and post pandemic for Canada will have access to historical data researchers on Kaggle before the end of the term, providing necessary trends to plan for community programs, run volunteer or spread awareness amongst vulnerable groups or demographics.
## 3. Milestones

1. Procure data from surveys by CAMH and CCDSS about mental health pre and post pandemic.

2. Install Python, R and jupyter notebooks for analysis on all local machines on team members.

3. Prepare the environment and devices for pulling the data (jupyter notebook).

4. Preprocess the data and store them on the local machine.

5. Host the data on a cloud server and get the access keys for their API.

6. Explore the data and try to find insights to plan for analysis.

7. Decide the type of ML algorithms and prepare data for those algorithms.

8. Create the models for those algorithms using various sets of hyper parameters.

9. Evaluate the model and decide on the best model for the problem.

10. Produce relevant visuals for the model and make sure they are interactive.

11. Convert the model into a library and post the code on Kaggle.

12. Host the visualization on a cloud server shiny R domain.
## 4. Deliverables

1. Cleaned and prepared data

2. Web API with visualizations

3. Analysis Report
## 5. Risks, Assumptions, and Constraints

### 5.1 Risks

· Sudden change in policy for data use by CAMH or CCDSS

· Sudden change in policy of kaggle for sharing projects of about sensitive matters like mental health

· Prices hike or change in server limits by cloud hosting service

· Python, R or notebook version changes that might require to alter the code
### 5.2 Assumptions

· The data about mental health is readily available for analysis

· Team members are well versed with Python and R for performing ML analysis
### 5.3 Constraints

· No personal information will be stored (and/or displayed) in the website besides names team members

· No unique identifiable health information will be stored or shared in the code, data or API.
